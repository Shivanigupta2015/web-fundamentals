<h1 align="center">HTML</h1>
<img align="right" src="./images/Html.webp" width="250" height="400" style="border-radius: 15px"/>

**HTML** stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web, such as text, images, links, tables, and multimedia.

- **HyperText:** Refers to the ability to link to other web pages using hyperlinks.
- **Markup Language:** Refers to the way tags are used to define elements within a document.

**HTML forms the backbone of all websites, often used alongside CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity).**

**HTML inveted by whom, when and why ---**

🔹  Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist and engineer, invented HTML.

🔹 HTML was first proposed and developed in 1989-1991 while Tim Berners-Lee was working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). 
  - The first version of HTML was released in 1991, containing 18 tags.

🔹 Tim Berners-Lee created HTML to:
  - Share and access scientific documents easily over the Internet.
  - Enable the linking of documents, allowing easy navigation from one document to another (via hyperlinks).
  - Build the foundation of the World Wide Web, a system for publishing and accessing interlinked hypertext documents.
  - His goal was to make information-sharing easier for researchers and scientists across the globe.

<h1 align="center">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h1>
<img align="right" src="./images/css.jpg" width="250" height="400" style="border-radius: 15px"/>

**CSS** stands for ***Cascading Style Sheets.*** It is the standard stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.

- **Cascading:** Refers to the way multiple style rules are applied in a priority order to determine the final appearance.
- **Style Sheets:** Collections of style rules that define how HTML elements should look.

**CSS works alongside HTML (which structures content) and JavaScript (which adds interactivity) to create visually appealing and responsive websites.**

---
**CSS invented by whom, when and why ---**

🔹CSS was created by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994, while working at CERN, and it was later developed further at the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).
-The first official CSS specification, CSS1, was published in 1996.

🔹 Håkon Wium Lie created CSS to:
- Separate the content (HTML) from its presentation, making web pages easier to maintain and update.
- Allow consistent styling across multiple web pages using external style sheets.
- Provide designers with better control over the look and feel of web content, including colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing.
- Improve web accessibility and create responsive designs that work across different devices and screen sizes.

<h1 align="center">JavaScript</h1>
<img align="right" src="./images/JS.jpg" width="250" height="400" style="border-radius: 15px"/>


**JavaScript** is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic behavior on websites. It allows developers to implement features like form validation, interactive maps, animations, and real-time updates.

- **Java:** The name was inspired by the popular Java language at the time, but JavaScript is not directly related to Java.
- **Script:** Refers to a lightweight, interpreted piece of code that can be executed in web browsers.

**JavaScript works alongside HTML (for structure) and CSS (for styling) to form the core technologies of the modern web.**

**JavaScript invented by whom, when and why:**

🔹JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich, an American computer programmer, in 1995 while working at Netscape Communications Corporation.

🔹He created the first version in just 10 days. It was initially named Mocha, then briefly LiveScript, and finally renamed to JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.

🔹 Brendan Eich created JavaScript to:

- Add interactivity and dynamic behavior to static HTML pages.
- Enable client-side scripting, allowing code to run directly in the browser without needing a server round-trip.
- Make web pages more engaging, functional, and responsive to user actions.
- Empower developers to build complex applications directly in the browser.

<h1 align="center">React</h1>
<img align="right" src="./images/react.jpg" width="250" height="400" style="border-radius: 15px"/>

**React** is a popular JavaScript library for building **user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs).** It enables developers to create fast, interactive, and dynamic front-end experiences using reusable components.

- **React:** The name comes from the idea of reactive programming, where the UI "reacts" to changes in state.
- **Library vs Framework:** React is a library, not a full framework—it focuses only on the view layer (UI) in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

**React works alongside JavaScript (for logic), HTML/JSX (for structure), and CSS (for styling) to build modern, component-based web applications.**

**React invented by whom, when, and why:**

🔹 React was invented by **Jordan Walke,** a software engineer at **Facebook, in 2011 and was open-sourced in March 2013.**

🔹 It was first used internally on Facebook’s News Feed, and later on Instagram.

🔹 Jordan Walke and the team at Facebook created React to:

- Improve the performance and scalability of Facebook’s complex UI.
- Enable declarative programming, so developers can describe what the UI should look like for a given state.
- Promote component-based architecture, encouraging modular, reusable, and testable code.
- Simplify DOM updates through a virtual DOM, making applications faster and more efficient.
- Help developers build large-scale applications with dynamic data that changes over time without reloading the page.
